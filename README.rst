Windows environment
===================

It is a project goal to support operation from MS Windows 8. For this OS, you
should install `Git for Windows`_ which bundles some GNU CLI tools and an
OpenSSH environment.

* During installation, allow Git to install the CLI tools into your ``PATH``.
* Set your ``HOME`` environment variable to ``%HOMEPATH%`` for SSH to work properly.
